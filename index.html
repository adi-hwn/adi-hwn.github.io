									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I come from Indonesia, and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
								</p>
								<h3> Math and Me </h3>
								<p>
									During my school years, I took part in a lot of math competitions, both regional and national level. In my final year of high school, I earned the opportunity to participate in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad, in Chiang Mai, Thailand. You can see how I did <a href="http://imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=25832"> here. </a>
								</p>
								<p>
									I would describe the IMO and other competitions I've been in as less about crunching numbers, and more about solving the puzzles given to us.
								</p>
								<p>
									Below is a picture of myself, my fellow participants from Indonesia, and two of my teachers (the leftmost and rightmost people), taken at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport after the IMO in Thailand.
									The text on the banner translates to "Congratulations to the Indonesian Math Olympiad Team in earning 2 Silver and 4 Bronze Medals, at the 56th IMO in Chiang Mai, Thailand, 4-16 July 2015"
								</p>

								<br/>
								<h3> Programming and Me </h3>
								<p>
									Before high school, programming was a hobby for me. I used ActionScript at first, then I moved on to Java. When high school came, I began to "connect" my math skills (such as problem-solving) to programming, and there I knew it was the career choice for me.

								<h4> Brilliant Competition </h4>
								<p>
									My school organizes an annual competition for junior high school stodents, and I've been a commitee member for each of the 3* years I was there. (In Indonesia, elementary school lasts 6 years, junior high 3, and high school 3). My jobs were to create the problem set, oversee the competition itself, and check the results. Additionally, in my final year I was chosen to be the head Problem Setter, which added planning the competition to my duties. 
									The website of the current Brilliant Competition can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.brilliantcompetition.com/"> here. </a>

								<h4> Titration Curve Software </h4>
								<p>
									A friend and I worked together on a research project for OPSI (Olimpiade Penelitian Siswa Indonesia/Indonesian Students' Research Olympiad). We derived an iterative formula that could accurately calculate the pH value of a given acid - base mixture. Based on that formula, I coded a JavaFX application that could compute the pH and draw titration curves based on it. 
									
									
									Screen shot of the program in action. I coded it in 2013, meaning newer versions of JavaFX no longer work well with it. The curve (of volume (mL) vs pH) still seems to work.
